/*
 * The Streams API supports different types of find operations on stream elements.
 * The following methods in the Stream interface are used to perform find operations:
 * 
 * 			Optional<T>   findAny()
 * 			Optional<T>   findFirst()
 * 
 * 
 * The primitive type streams such as IntStream, LongStream, and DoubleStream 
 * 				also contain the same methods that work with a predicate and an optional one for primitive types.
 * All find operations are terminal operations. They are also short-circuiting operations. 
 * 				A short-circuiting operation may not have to process the entire stream to return the result.
