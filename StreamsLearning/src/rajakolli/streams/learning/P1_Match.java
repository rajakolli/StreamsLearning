 * The Streams API supports different types of match operations on stream elements.
 * The following methods in the Stream interface are used to perform match operations:
 * 
 * 			boolean allMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
 * 			boolean anyMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
 * 			boolean noneMatch(Predicate<? super  T> predicate)
 * 
 * 
 * The primitive type streams such as IntStream, LongStream, and DoubleStream 
 * 				also contain the same methods that work with a predicate and an optional one for primitive types.
 * All match operations are terminal operations. They are also short-circuiting operations. 
 * 				A short-circuiting operation may not have to process the entire stream to return the result.
 *
