 * Streams can be sequential or parallel.
 * Operations on a sequential stream are processed in serial by one thread.
 * Operations on a parallel stream are processed in parallel using multiple threads.
 * Most of the methods in the Streams API produce sequential streams by default. 
 * 		To create a parallel stream from a collection such as a List or a Set, 
 * 				call the parallelStream() method of the Collection interface.
 * Use the parallel() method on a stream to convert a sequential stream into a parallel stream.
 * Use the sequential() method on a stream to convert a parallel stream into a sequential stream.
