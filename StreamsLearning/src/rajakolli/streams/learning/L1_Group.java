/*
 * The groupingBy() method from the Collectors class 
 * 		returns a collector that groups the data before collecting them in a Map. 
 * 	It is similar to a "group by" clause in SQL.
 * 
 * 

The groupingBy() method is overloaded and it has three versions:
 * 		* groupingBy(Function<? super  T,?  extends K>  classifier)
 * 		* groupingBy(Function<? super  T,?  extends K>  classifier,  Collector<? super T,A,D> downstream)
 * 		* groupingBy(Function<? super  T,?  extends K>  classifier, Supplier<M>  mapFactory, Collector<? super T,A,D> downstream)
 * 
 * 
 * In the first two versions, the collector takes care of creating the Map object for you. 
 * The third version allows us to specify a Supplier used as the factory to get the Map object.
 * 
 * 'cassifier' function generates the keys in the map. collector performs a reduction operation on the values associated with each key.
 * The following code shows how to group people by gender and count the number of people in each group.
 * The counting() method of the Collectors class returns a Collector to count the number of elements in a stream.
 *
